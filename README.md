# BetterDiscordPlugins

[BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/) is an enhancement utility for [Discord](https://discordapp.com/).
It allows you to install custom themes and plugins which modify the way Discord works. This repo contains all the different plugins I have developed for BetterDiscord.

Each file has complete instructions at the top of the file, but here is the steps to install a plugin:

## Installation
 1. Open the script you want on GitHub
 2. Click the "Raw" button in the corner
 3. Save the file as a .js file
 4. place the file in %appdata%/BetterDiscord/plugins
 5. Refresh Discord (ctrl+R)
 6. Go to User Settings > BetterDiscord > Plugins
 7. Enable the plugin by checking the checkbox

## Plugins

Here is a short description for each plugin

#### TabCompletion
This plugin let's you tab complete emote names that you have favorited.
Simply add emotes to favorites by clicking the start in the top right,
then as you're typing the name of the emote, press tab to complete the name.

#### ImageEmote
This plugin allows you to send a small emote-like image (as an attachment) with a simple chat command.
You can add as many custom images and associated commands as you need in the plugin settings.

#### ReorderServers
This plugin is not available anymore. I recommend using [CosmicSalad's plugin](https://github.com/cosmicsalad/Discord-Themes-and-Plugins/blob/master/plugins/SortServers.js) for this.

#### Custom Highlight
Allows you to set custom words to be highlighted in Discord.
